Hi, I am Max Rosenzweig. I am a Sophomore in LSA currently, but I am a preferred admit to the School of Information. Yet, I am not sure what concentration I will be doing. :/ A fun fact is that I just started picking up embroidery due to a recent quarantine, so I can embroider you something if you pay me!
